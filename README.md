# City-View-Tents-Design-Software

My Newest project! 

Project Goals:

- Use Java to create a drag and drop program which allows users to design different layouts for tents of different sizes 
- Once user has finished their design they can click "Finish" button and a list of all items needed for setup will be displayed
- Use Google's static maps api so Users can input a potential clients address and then plan design on top of birds eye view of their property
- Save all of the users designs in a SQL database
- Use an email/phone api to send out a message to user stating which items are needed for setup, picture of design, and the date of tent setup
- Create web application which will dispaly upcoming jobs with their designs, their items needed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
